# Bootstrap Portfolio

## About The Repository

The purpose of this repository is to present my portfolio of work. I utilized bootstrap to create a resposive home, portfolio, and contact page. These pages were created utilizing the grid provided by Bootstrap. Each page has a consistent header and a sticky footer.
